# Causal_Inference_for_Digital_Marketing

Techniques Utilized: R, Difference-in-Differences (DiD)

## Business Overview
Bazaar(Bazaar.com) is a leading online retailer in the United States that runs paid ads on two major search engines, Google and Bing, using display and search engine advertising. Bazaar's paid ads keywords are classified into two board categories: branded and non-branded. Branded keywords include keywords such as "Bazaar," and "Bazaar shoes" that contain the Bazaar brand name. In contrast, non-branded keywords include keywords such as "shoes" and "guitar" that do not contain the Bazaar brand name.

Regarding the sponsored search ads for branded keywords on Google, Bob, a senior marketing analyst at Bazaar, conducted the 320% ROI on this ad spend. However, his ROI analysis is skeptical because it is possible that people who searched with the word "Bazaar" already have the intention to visit Bazaar.com, hence the effectiveness of branded keyword ads is implausible.

Our goal here is to report an accurate estimate of the ROI associated with Sponsored Search advertising being run by Bazaar.com, based on the natural experiment by addressing the following set of questions:

What is Wrong with Bobâ€™s ROI analysis?
what are the treatment and control of the experiment? What's potential threat of experiment?
Is the First Difference reliable to estimate the casual effect of the treatment?
How should we compare with Difference-in-Differences estimator?
Based on new treatment effect, what should be the corrected ROI?
